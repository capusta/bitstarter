SuiMo!
========

Suimo! is a web service that allows tourists to purchase Suica and Passmo cards when traveling to Japan.  Bitcoins are
converted into Yen and added onto the card.  The card is mailed to the customer before they arrive in Japan.  Once used
(or not used) the card is mailed back to us - and we refund in bitcoins whatever is left on it.

The app runs on Heroku.
